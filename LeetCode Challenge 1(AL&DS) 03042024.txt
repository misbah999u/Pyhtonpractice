LeetCode Challenge 1(AL&DS) 03/04/2024

-> Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is a printable ascii character.
Solution: 
class Solution(object):
    def reverseString(self, s):
        """
        :type s: List[str]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        return s.reverse()

Explanation: This is a Python class `Solution` with a method `reverseString` that takes a list of strings `s` as input. The method reverses the elements of the list `s` in-place using the `reverse()` method. The method does not return anything explicitly (`rtype: None`), but modifies the list `s` directly.
