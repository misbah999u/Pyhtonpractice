-> Table: Employee

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   |  Type   |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| department_id | int     |
| primary_flag  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
(employee_id, department_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
employee_id is the id of the employee.
department_id is the id of the department to which the employee belongs.
primary_flag is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N'). If the flag is 'Y', the department is the primary department for the employee. If the flag is 'N', the department is not the primary.
 

Employees can belong to multiple departments. When the employee joins other departments, they need to decide which department is their primary department. Note that when an employee belongs to only one department, their primary column is 'N'.

Write a solution to report all the employees with their primary department. For employees who belong to one department, report their only department.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| employee_id | department_id | primary_flag |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| 1           | 1             | N            |
| 2           | 1             | Y            |
| 2           | 2             | N            |
| 3           | 3             | N            |
| 4           | 2             | N            |
| 4           | 3             | Y            |
| 4           | 4             | N            |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
Output: 
+-------------+---------------+
| employee_id | department_id |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 1             |
| 2           | 1             |
| 3           | 3             |
| 4           | 3             |

Explanation: 
- The Primary department for employee 1 is 1.
- The Primary department for employee 2 is 1.
- The Primary department for employee 3 is 3.
- The Primary department for employee 4 is 3.

Solution:

SELECT 
    employee_id,
    department_id
FROM 
    Employee
WHERE 
    primary_flag = 'Y'

UNION

SELECT 
    employee_id,
    department_id
FROM 
    Employee
WHERE 
    employee_id NOT IN (
        SELECT 
            employee_id
        FROM 
            Employee
        WHERE 
            primary_flag = 'Y'
    );

Explanation: This query first selects employees with a primary department and then combines it with employees who don't have a primary department but belong to only one department. It does this by selecting all employees with 'Y' as their primary_flag and then combining it with the employees whose employee_id is not present in the subquery that selects employees with 'Y' as their primary_flag. This should give the correct output for all cases.
