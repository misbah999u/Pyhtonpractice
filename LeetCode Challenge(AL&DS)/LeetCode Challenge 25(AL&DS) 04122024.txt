LeetCode Challenge 25(AL&DS) 04/12/2024
-> Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

 

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.
Solution:
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack, needle):
        for i in range(len(haystack) - len(needle) + 1):
            if haystack[i:i+len(needle)] == needle:
                return i
        return -1

Explanation: This code defines a method strStr within a class Solution. This method aims to find the index of the first occurrence of a substring (needle) within a larger string (haystack).
