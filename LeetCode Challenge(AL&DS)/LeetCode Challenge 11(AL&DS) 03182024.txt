LeetCode Challenge 11(AL&DS) 03/18/2024

-> Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
 

Constraints:

1 <= strs.length <= 200
0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.

Solution: class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        pref = strs[0]
        pref_len = len(pref)

        for s in strs[1:]:
            while pref != s[0:pref_len]:
                pref_len -= 1
                if pref_len == 0:
                    return ""
                
                pref = pref[0:pref_len]
        
        return pref

Explanation: Finally, it returns the pref, which represents the longest common prefix among all the strings in strs.
