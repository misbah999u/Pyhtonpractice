LeetCode Challenge 63(AL&DS) 07/01/2024
->Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
Example 2:


Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
Output: [2,0,1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 500].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
0 <= k <= 2 * 109

Solution:
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        
        if not head:
            return None
        
        lastElement = head
        length = 1
        # get the length of the list and the last node in the list
        while ( lastElement.next ):
            lastElement = lastElement.next
            length += 1

        # If k is equal to the length of the list then k == 0
        # ElIf k is greater than the length of the list then k = k % length
        k = k % length
            
        # Set the last node to point to head node
        # The list is now a circular linked list with last node pointing to first node
        lastElement.next = head
        
        # Traverse the list to get to the node just before the ( length - k )th node.
        # Example: In 1->2->3->4->5, and k = 2
        #          we need to get to the Node(3)
        tempNode = head
        for _ in range( length - k - 1 ):
            tempNode = tempNode.next
        
        # Get the next node from the tempNode and then set the tempNode.next as None
        # Example: In 1->2->3->4->5, and k = 2
        #          tempNode = Node(3)
        #          answer = Node(3).next => Node(4)
        #          Node(3).next = None ( cut the linked list from here )
        answer = tempNode.next
        tempNode.next = None
        
        return answer

Explanation: This solution rotates a linked list to the right by `k` positions. It first calculates the length of the list, then makes the list circular by connecting the last node to the head. It determines the new tail position by traversing the list to the `(length - k)`th node, breaks the circle at that point, and returns the new head.
