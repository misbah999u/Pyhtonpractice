-> Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
t.length == s.length
s and t consist of any valid ascii character.

Solution:
class Solution:
    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        indexS = [0] * 200 # Stores index of characters in string s
        indexT = [0] * 200 # Stores index of characters in string t
        
        length = len(s) # Get the length of both strings
        
        if length != len(t): # If the lengths of the two strings are different, they can't be isomorphic
            return False
        
        for i in range(length): # Iterate through each character of the strings
            if indexS[ord(s[i])] != indexT[ord(t[i])]: # Check if the index of the current character in string s is different from the index of the corresponding character in string t
                return False # If different, strings are not isomorphic
            
            indexS[ord(s[i])] = i + 1 # updating position of current character
            indexT[ord(t[i])] = i + 1
        
        return True # If the loop completes without returning false, strings are isomorphic

Explanation: This Python solution, defined within a class, determines whether two given strings are isomorphic. It achieves this by mapping each character of the two strings to an index and comparing the indices. If the indices of corresponding characters in the two strings differ, the strings are not isomorphic. Otherwise, if the loop completes without finding any mismatch, the strings are considered isomorphic, and the function returns True.
