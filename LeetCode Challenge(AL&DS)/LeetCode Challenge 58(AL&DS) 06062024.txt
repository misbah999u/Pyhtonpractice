LeetCode Challenge 58(AL&DS) 06/06/2024
-> Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome
, and false otherwise.
Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

Solution: class Solution(object):
    def isPalindrome(self, x):
        if x < 0 or (x != 0 and x % 10 == 0):
            return False

        half = 0
        while x > half:
            half = (half * 10) + (x % 10)
            x = x // 10

        return x == half or x == half // 10

Explanation: This Python method checks if an integer \( x \) is a palindrome. It first handles edge cases where \( x \) is negative or ends in zero, then reverses half of the digits of \( x \) and compares this reversed half to the remaining digits to determine if they match, indicating a palindrome.
