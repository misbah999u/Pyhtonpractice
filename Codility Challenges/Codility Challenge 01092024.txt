-> A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The array contains an odd number of elements, and each element of the array can be paired with another element that has the same value, except for one element that is left unpaired.

For example, in array A such that:

  A[0] = 9  A[1] = 3  A[2] = 9
  A[3] = 3  A[4] = 9  A[5] = 7
  A[6] = 9
the elements at indexes 0 and 2 have value 9,
the elements at indexes 1 and 3 have value 3,
the elements at indexes 4 and 6 have value 9,
the element at index 5 has value 7 and is unpaired.
Write a function:

def solution(A)

that, given an array A consisting of N integers fulfilling the above conditions, returns the value of the unpaired element.

For example, given array A such that:

  A[0] = 9  A[1] = 3  A[2] = 9
  A[3] = 3  A[4] = 9  A[5] = 7
  A[6] = 9
the function should return 7, as explained in the example above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an odd integer within the range [1..1,000,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
all but one of the values in A occur an even number of times.

Solution:

def solution(A):
    result = 0

    for number in A:
        result ^= number

    return result

# Example usage:
A = [9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 7, 9]
print(solution(A))

Output: 
7

Explanation: 
Here we are making use of the XOR implementation. To easily understand we can say that all the elements occur even number of times except one which further reduce the space complexity. Performing XORing a number with itslef is 0. 

def solution(A):: This line defines a function named solution that takes an array A as its parameter.

result = 0: Initializes a variable result to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the XOR of all elements in the array.

for number in A:: This is a for loop that iterates over each element number in the array A.

result ^= number: Performs the XOR operation (^= is the XOR-assignment operator) between the current value of result and the current element number. This operation is used to accumulate the XOR of all elements in the array.

XORing a number with itself is 0.
XORing 0 with any number gives that number.
XORing is commutative and associative, so the order of XOR operations doesn't matter.
As a result, after XORing all the elements in the array, the result will contain the value of the unpaired element.

return result: Returns the final result after XORing all elements in the array.

Example usage:

python
Copy code
A = [9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 7, 9]
print(solution(A))
Outputs the value of the unpaired element in the given example array, which is 7.

In summary, this code efficiently finds the unpaired element in an array with the given assumptions using the XOR operation. It takes advantage of the properties of XOR to handle the odd occurrences and pairs in the array.
