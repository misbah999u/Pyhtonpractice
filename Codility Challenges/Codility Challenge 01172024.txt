-> Write a function

def solution(A)

that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of distinct values in array A.

For example, given array A consisting of six elements such that:

 A[0] = 2    A[1] = 1    A[2] = 1
 A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 1
the function should return 3, because there are 3 distinct values appearing in array A, namely 1, 2 and 3.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000,000..1,000,000].

Solution: 

def solution(A):
    A.sort()
    
    count = 0
    previous_elem = None
    
    for elem in A:
        if elem != previous_elem:
            count += 1
            previous_elem = elem
    
    return count

exam_array = [2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1]
resulting = solution(exam_array)
print(f"The number of distinct values in the array is: {resulting}")

Explanation: We start with two variables: `count` and `prev_element`. The purpose of `count` is to keep count of how many different values we have encountered so far. On the other hand, `prev_element` is a memory box that holds the value of the element we looked at last as we go through the list.
